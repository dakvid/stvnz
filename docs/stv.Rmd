title: "What is STV?"
---

Single Transferable Vote (STV) is a voting system where voters rank candidates,
and generally results in fairer outcomes than traditional First Past the Post (FPP).
If you like cartoon animal videos, there's one that provides a nice
overview:

There are a number of ways of counting STV ballots.
In New Zealand we use a system devised by
[Meek in 1969](http://www.votingmatters.org.uk/ISSUE1/P1.HTM)
and enshrined in the 
[Local Electoral Act 2001](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2001/0035/latest/DLM93435.html).
For more detail, have a read of
[the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_single_transferable_votes)
or [a blogpost I wrote](https://david.frigge.nz/posts/2016-11-simple-to-vote/)
a couple of years ago.
