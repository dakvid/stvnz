New Zealand STV Election Results
================================

Website showing results of Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections in New Zealand:

That's in the docs folder. Everything else is the iteration reports I gathered
in 2016, and my initial unfinished attempts to wrangle them into a consistent
data source.

For now (Nov 2019) I'm focussing on filling out and expanding the website, and
I'll come back to the other stuff later on.
